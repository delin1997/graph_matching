# graph_matching

This project implementes several graph matching algorithms in R(including SM(spectral matching) and SMAC(spectral matching with affine constraints)). 
An experiment on synthetic data(plz refer to [demoToy.R](https://github.com/delin1997/graph_matching/blob/master/demoToy.R)) is also provided.
